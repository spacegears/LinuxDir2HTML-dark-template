# LinuxDir2HTML-dark-template

I absolutely loved [Snap2HTML](https://www.rlvision.com/snap2html/) back in my Windows days and I was thrilled to see that it was also ported over to Linux as [LinuxDir2HTML](https://github.com/homeisfar/LinuxDir2HTML) when I made the switch in 2021. It has pretty much everything you need and nothing you don't, the only thing I was missing was the option for a dark theme. So here it is, my version of a dark theme, maybe others will find it useful, too. The goal was to be as consistent with the colors as possible, also to have as few changes as possible.

I didn't want to fork the official repository, so you'll need to download this template separately.

### Installation
Make a backup or rename the original `template.html` in the `linuxdir2html` folder, then copy this version over there. Run the script to create a new file using the dark template.

This is **optional**, but you can also replace the icon in the upper left corner. In order to do that, you can use this [Base64 Image Encoder](https://www.base64-image.de) tool to convert any image to base64 code, then copy the code from the `For use as CSS background:` section and replace the `background` property value in line 95 of the template. After that, run the script again to create a file using the new icon.

### Feedback
I would love to hear you feedback! Should you have any questions or improvement ideas, free to open a new issue or a pull request.
